My sculptures reflect everyday activity and are designed to wobble accordingly”. \n\nA visit to her local scrap and steel yard stimulates her visionary process resulting in a car full of ‘treasure’ of both timber and wire varieties. Felicity’s sculptures are presented as still sketches but when you realise the thought put into every twist and curve of wire you will be amazed at her skillful technique. \n\nGraduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (UNSW) 23 years ago, Felicity teaches and practices art and is involved in the local visual art scene in picturesque Mudgee. She regularly exhibits in the annual Sculptures in the Garden at Rosby, Mudgee and the Mid West Waste to Art competition to great success, she has recently won the Artist's Choice Award in the Gauge Gallery Glebe 'Just Art' competition 2017 and the People's Choice Award at the 2017 York festival in Western Australia.",

A larger than life-size, bronze sculpture to commemorate the 165th anniversary of the Great Flood of Gundagai in 1852.\nThe sculpture celebrates the heroic work of Yarri and Jacky Jacky, along with other members of the Wiradjuri tribe in saving some 69 townsfolk from the flood waters.\n\nOn the night of June 24, 1852 two Wiradjuri men, Yarri and Jacky Jacky, rescued one third of the Gundagai town's residents in frail bark canoes from the flooded Murrumbidgee River.  It was a protracted rescue effort, continuing over some days and nights.\n\nThis sculpture is a must see in this beautiful country town!",

Books are not their covers. One size does not fit all.\n\nKelly and his ensemble move with assured physicality in this high-energy work that pulses with humour, play and personal stories. Voice and body become pathways to traditional dance and song, as repetition and disguise make way for moments of discovery.\n\n[Mis]conceive brings audiences through the past, to understand the present, and move forward into a better future.",

With the cast in place, Jeff and Hunter begin a conversation about what to write about. Eventually, Jeff suggests they write about what to write about. They make a pact to write up until the festival's deadline and dream about the show changing their lives.\n\nIn the span of 90 minutes they write and perform their show at the festival and learn lessons about themselves as people, friends and artists. [title of show] is, above all, a love letter to the musical theatre, a uniquely American art form, and to the joy of collaboration.\n\nThis show contains low level occasional bad language.
